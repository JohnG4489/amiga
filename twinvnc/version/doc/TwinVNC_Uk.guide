@{b}@{u}Description@{uu}@{ub}

TwinVNC is a VNC client (or viewer) allowing control of  a  computer  running  a
@{"VNC server" link "Doc_Servers" 0}.
TwinVNC has been programmed from scratch on Amiga and compiled with SAS/C.  It's
based  on  the  RFB  communication   protocol  (version   3.8),   available   at
www.realvnc.org.
TwinVNC is not  an  open  source  project  for  the  moment.  It  will  be  when
considered ready.
TwinVNC is now @{"GiftWare" link "Doc_Giftware" 0}.

@{b}@{u}History@{uu}@{ub}

0.9beta (15/02/2023):
    * Added  : - Keyboard shortcut AmigaR+D: Switches the display  to  NODISPLAY
               mode (full screen without refresh).
               - Keyboard shortcut AmigaR+P: Allows you  to  resize  the  window
               proportionally without using the mouse. This  option  also  works
               in full screen mode.
               - Emulation of the "square" key via AmigaR+'`'.
               - Added the CTRLKEY  argument.  This  option  allows  the  AmigaR
               control key to be redefined for TwinVNC shortcuts.
               - Management of file transfer up  and  down.  This  option  works
               @{b}ONLY@{ub} with a Tight 1.x or 2.x server.
               It is accessible via  the  AmigaR+K  shortcut.  This  option  may
               require the installation of the codesets.library.
               - Add "Requirement" section in the doc.
               - Support of Tight authentication.

    * Changes : - Improved   keyboard   management :  Some    combinations    of
               "AltLeft+alphabetic key" did not work.
               - Shielding of TwinVNC to avoid a  crash  in  certain  conditions
               with Vnc4server.
               - Updated the ZLib lib to 1.2.13
               - Removed the blocking of mouse movements around the  borders  of
               the window.
               - Redesign of the code layer that manages the display.
               - Minor fix on the use of sockets.
               - Proportional resizing now takes into account the  screen  pixel
               ratio.
               - Minor fix on Amiga OS4  and  MorphOS  with  the  reduce/enlarge
               window button. TwinVNC now repositions the window if it overflows
               the screen.
               - Elimination of some hidden enforcer hits + Fix of  a  crash  in
               overlay mode.
               - Possibility to cancel the connection during the  contact  phase
               of the host.
               - Modification of the management of  accented  characters.  These
               characters did not work on a more recent Tight server.  They  now
               work on the latest versions of Tight, but will no longer work  on
               a Tight 1.3.x server.
               - Improved automatic screen mode detection in full screen mode.

0.8beta (09/04/2007):
    * Added  : - [DOC] Added a "testimonies" menu of day-to-day TwinVNC users.
               - Possibility to save your options in a workbench icon.
               - A localized Information box that displays technical information
               about the server connection.
               - The "Reconnect" toolbar button is now available.
               - New NODISPLAY option.  This  option  allows  you  to  stop  the
               incremental refresh display on  the  TwinVNC  side  (an  RAmiga+R
               shortcut allows you to  force  a  global  screen  refresh).  This
               improvement was submitted by Crisot. It is useful when  you  have
               an Amiga as well as another computer that  both  have  their  own
               screen, but with only one mouse and keyboard.
               You can thus control this remote computer with low CPU  usage  on
               both machines, as the Amiga screen is not refreshed on the client
               side and then not compressed and sent on the server side.
               Note that this option forces full screen mode without the toolbar
               or screen bar to avoid erratic mouse behaviours when out  of  the
               display zone.
               - New "Test" button in the options box that allows you to preview
               options modifications without having to close this window.
               - Added the RAmiga+Enter shortcut. This option forces the  window
               to be resized with the startup predefined settings, or 100% if no
               size has been defined.
               - Added the CRYPT and SPASS parameters which allow the use of  an
               encrypted password in your icon  tooltypes  or  in  your  command
               line. The Crypt option is only available for icon use. It can  be
               used to encrypt a non-crypted password string.
               Example: TwinVNC CRYPT="abcd" will encrypt the "abcd" string that
               you will use with SPASS parameter instead of the PASS  parameter.
               Thus, your password will be fully encrypted.
               - The aspect of  the  mouse  cursor  has  been  modified  in  the
               "View Only" mode.
               - Added the NOREPORTMOUSE parameter that allows  you  to  disable
               the transfer of mouse movement data from the server.
               - Third  mouse  button  emulated  for  two-button   mouses:   Use
               left-click+RAmiga shortcut.
               - Font properties are now available in the Customise page of  the
               options box.
               - Added the SMOOTH parameter. This enables soft smoothing of  the
               scale mode, using an RTG monitor or  not.  This  option  is  also
               available on the options box.

    * Changes: - RTG blits are now non-aligned on 32 bits. This change was  made
               because of a graphics.library bug, but it was not required in RTG
               mode.
               - Some memory optimisations for normal display  mode  in  256  or
               65536 colors.
               - Fixed mouse cursor display bug using the cursor option  of  the
               options box. The mouse cursor was erratically displayed.
               - Fixed window title bar refresh when the graphical resolution of
               the server changes.
               - Deleted the specific TS + Shift key fix. This patch caused some
               problems with OSX Vnc.
               - Fixed a toolbar display bug when toolbar  was  enabled/disabled
               via the options box.
               - Others minors bugs fixed.

0.7beta (10/04/2006):
    * Added  : - Tooltip support for toolbar buttons.
               - Connection box, status box and options box added with  language
               specific text.
               - Added TOP, LEFT, WIDTH and HEIGHT arguments to  force  position
               and dimension of window view. TwinVNC  centre  the  display  when
               these values are not defined.
               - Toolbar is now available in full public screen.
               - Added RAmiga+T shortcut to toggle ON/OFF toolbar display.
               - Scale display mode is now available in full  screen  (up  scale
               and down scale).
               - Upscale is now available in window mode.
               - Overlay is now available in full screen (up  overlay  and  down
               overlay).
               - Added "proportional resize"  option  of  the  window.  You  can
               resize the window view  with  Left  Shift  or  Right  Amiga  keys
               depressed.  The  window  will  be   resized   with   proportional
               dimensions of original view.
               - Added NOSHARED argument to start VNC in share mode.
               - Added VIEWONLY argument to start VNC with  mouse  and  keyboard
               locked.
               - Added SCREENBAR argument to force displaying the screen bar  on
               the public screen. Use RAmiga+B shortcut to change this setting.
               - Added support of the server  pixel  format.  TwinVNC  uses  the
               depth and pixel proporties of the server  by  default.  You  must
               force the DEPTH option if you  use  low  cost  bandwidth  graphic
               mode.
               - Mousewheel management on AmigaOS4.
               - Added FONTNAME and FONTSIZE arguments to select the font to use
               with the graphical interface.
               - Implementation of the socket NODELAY option. This improves  the
               fluidity of the server side mouse.

    * Changes: - Upgrades zlib library with version 1.2.3.
               - TwinVNC now uses the  disk  icon  as  AppIcon  to  iconify  the
               application, if it exists.
               - The default  icon  is  replaced  by  a  cool icon  designed  by
               Highlander.
               - Some overlay optimisations.
               - Fix to  bypass  a  system  crash  in  certain  conditions  with
               overlay when you resize window with 0x0 inner dimensions.
               - Fix overlay with toolbar. A black  bar  was  displayed  at  the
               bottom  of  the  window.  This  bug   was   caused   by   a   bad
               implementation of the cgxvideo.library on my OS. I  have  created
               a patch to fix  this  bug  (See  PatchOverlay  command  available
               in the TwinVNC archive).
               - Fix of an iconify effect. TwinVNC was  uniconified  (maximised)
               when remote screen resolution was changed.
               - Optimisation of Hextile, Tight and ZRle codecs.
               - Fix a soft scale display bug that  caused  black  vertical  and
               horizontal lines.
               - Optimisation of memory consommation and speed up scale mode.
               - Fix to allow connection with empty password.
               - Fix a minor bug in the Tight codec with Jpeg  option.  The  bug
               was visible if you exited TwinVNC during Jpeg refresh.
               - Fix a system freeze bug in AGA caused by a  bad  implementation
               of WriteChunkyPixel() of  graphics.library.  Graphics  blits  are
               now aligned in 32 bytes to bypass this bug.
               - Fix a deconnection problem in TwinVNC due to the  reception  of
               an empty clipboard.
               - Changes made to behaviour of ZLib feature. You must  now  force
               this feature to change the value used by the server.
               - Changed DOVERLAY by OVERLAY.  This  argument  allow  to  define
               threshold (in percent) of activation of the hard  scale.  Default
               value -1 mean "no overlay". 100% mean "overlay in  upscale".  And
               0% mean "always use overlay".
               - The NOCURSOR option is now by default  and  the  CURSOR  option
               replaces it.
               - Improvement of the shift  key  management  on  Terminal  server
               software.

0.6betadev1 (28/02/2005):
    * Added  : - Improved Scale mode without filtering (use  SCALE  Argument  or
               RAmiga+S shortcut).
               - Added MODEID argument to  set  screen  mode  ID  of  fullscreen
               mode.
               - Clipboard management. Use NOCLIPBOARD to desactivate this.
               - New NOLAMIGAKEY argument.
               - New ICONIFY argument to start TwinVNC on iconify mode.

    * Changes: - Some keyboard shortcut changes (RAmiga+S and RAmiga+Del).
               - Overlay management modification with scale option.
               - Changed USEOVERLAY by DOVERLAY.
               - Improved keyboard management (F11, F12, Page  Down/Up,  Insert,
               Pause, Scroll Lock, Begin/End).

               It was switching/de-switching too fast!

0.5betadev5:
    * Added  : Toolbar support.
      Added  : Added KBEMUL argument  to  force  emulation  of  PageUp/PageDown,
               Begin/End keys thru RShift+Arrow keys.

@endnode


@node "Doc_Specification" "Specifications"
@{b}@{u}Specifications@{uu}@{ub}

TwinVNC can use several screen depths, RTG or AGA (default is RTG). It uses zlib
version 1.2.13 for certain codecs.

@{b}@{i}* Supported codecs are:@{ui}@{ub}
    RAW         : supported by all VNC servers (worst efficiency)

    RRE         : supported by all VNC servers (poor efficiency)

    CoRRE       : supported by TightVNC (poor efficiency)

    HexTile     : supported by all servers (medium efficiency)

    ZLibHex     : supported by TightVNC. Like HexTile with  compression  of  RAW
                  parts. (not so much better than HexTile)

    ZLibRaw     : supported by TightVNC. Like RAW with ZLib compression.
                  (good efficiency)

    ZRle        : supported by RealVNC. Special encoding with ZLib compression.
                  Gives good results with depth less than 8-bits.
                  (good efficiency)

    Tight       : supported by TightVNC.  Very  efficient  with  ZLib  and  JPEG
                  support (16 and 32 bits.)


@{b}@{i}* Supported sub-codecs:@{ui}@{ub}
    XCursor     : supported by TigthVNC. Support of local cursor (2 colors)

    RichCursor  : supported by  all  servers.  Support  of  local  cursor  (true
                  color)

    CopyRect    : supported by all servers.


@{b}@{u}About the use of codecs@{uu}@{ub}

TwinVNC supported codecs are not present in all VNC servers:

- RealVNC4 has the following codecs
  RAW, RRE, Hextile and ZRle.
  Also: RichCursor and CopyRect.

- Servers TightVNC1.2.9 to TightVNC1.3beta6 support
  RAW, RRE, CoRRE, Hextile, ZLibHex, ZLibRaw and Tight.
  Also supported: XCursor, RichCursor and CopyRect.

- Latest UltraVNC server has all TwinVNC supported codecs.
  Note : After a few local  tests,  I  noticed  UltraVNC  was  far  slower  than
  TightVNC, with TwinVNC as client.

   ASKMODEID    : Screenmode requester for fullscreen mode

   MODEID       : Screen mode ID to use for fullscreen mode

   DEPTH        : Screen depth (3, 6, 8, 16 or 32).
                  If this argument is set to 0 or if not  exists,  then  TwinVNC
                  uses the server graphics settings.

   SERVERSCALE  : (EXPERIMENTAL ! Do not use !)

   ZLIB         : Specifies ZLib compression level.
                  Possible values: 0->9 (server uses its value by default)

                  option can be disabled by using the options box.
                  The idea is to control a remote computer with a  local  screen
                  but without mouse or keyboard.
                  The client and server cpus charges should be lowered.
                  Note: this option forces a full screen  mode  without  ToolBar
                  nor  ScreenBar  in  order  to  avoid  erratic   mouse   cursor
                  behaviour. The RAmiga+R shortcut allows  you  to  display  the
                  current remote screen.

   VIEWONLY     : Lock mouse and keyboard.

   OVERLAY      : Define threshold of activation of the overlay in percent.
                  Example:
                  - "-1" or no argument mean "don't use overlay"
                  - "100" mean "overlay in upscale"
                  - "0" mean "always use overlay"

   SCALE        : Forces display to be resized with window dimensions.
                  This option can be use with OVERLAY argument  to  use  graphic
                  card hardware functionnalities.

   SMOOTH       : Enables soft smooth of the scale mode.
                  Note: the algorithm is optimized to only use your cpu  integer
                  unit.

   ICONIFY      : Start TwinVNC on iconify mode.

   LEFT         : Defines vertical position of the window (centered by default).

   FONTSIZE     : Defines  the  font  size  of  the  font  used  with  graphical
                  interface (8 by default). Min=1 and Max=n.

   CTRLKEY      : *@{b}NEW@{ub}* Allows you to redefine the control key of TwinVNC.
                  By default the AmigaR key is defined.
                  This option only accepts the grey "Qualifier" keys.
                  Here is a list of the names of the combinable keys:
                  - CTRL: Control key
                  - LSHIFT: Left shift key
                  - RSHIFT: Right shift key

                  options interface.
                  By default, the RAMIGA option is used.
                  It is possible to define a combination of keys  by  separating
                  them with the "+" separator. Example: CTRLKEY="CTRL+LSHIFT"

   CRYPT        : Allows you to encrypt a password string that can be used  with
                  the SPASS parameter.
                  Example: TwinVNC CRYPT="abcd"
                  Returns the encrypted string that can be used with  the  SPASS
                  parameter to encrypt your password on  your  command  line  or

@{b}@{u}Required@{uu}@{ub}

In  absolute  terms,  TwinVNC  is  designed  to  run  on  a  freshly   installed
Amiga OS 3.1 with a basic TCP/IP stack.
However, to work properly, TwinVNC may need some additional libraries.

* RTG library:
  TwinVNC  supports  both  types  of  RTG  systems  on  the  Amiga:  Picasso  or
  Cybergraphics. The installation is your responsibility.


* Codesets
  The installation of the codesets.library is required when  transferring  files
  with a Tight 2.x server.
  TwinVNC incorporates its own UTF8<->Latin1 charset conversion routines if this
  library is not installed. It should be installed if the charsets of the  amiga
  and the remote server are not Latin1 (i.e. Ansi/ISO-8859-1).
  Link on Aminet: http://aminet.net/util/libs/codesets-6.19.lha

* Catalogs
  The TwinVNC interface is in English by default. You must install  the  catalog
  for your language if needed.

@node "Doc_Bugs" "Bugs connus"
@{b}@{u}Known bugs (more or less...)@{uu}@{ub}

In fact, these are not functionality bugs.
No user has yet reported crashes related to TwinVNC. The identified crash causes
came from external elements.


@{b}* But there are crashes anyway...@{ub}
    TwinVNC can potentially crash your system if it connects  to  an  unreliable
    VNC server. This is the case with some VNC servers  which  have  incorrectly
    implemented codecs.
    Except for the CoRRE codec, TwinVNC does  not  control  graphic  information
    sent by the server. If the server requires  to  fill  a  rectangle  that  is
    larger  than  the  screen,  TwinVNC  will  perform  it;  that  may  cause  a
    potentially fatal border effect.

@{b}* What about the overlay?@{ub}
    The overlay can cause  the  following  issues  depending  on  the  graphical
    configs:
    - Some configs don't support the downscaled overlay. In such a case, use the
    "OVERLAY=100" parameter.
    - Others configs don't support the  downscaled  overlay  under  50%  of  the
    original size. In this case, use the "OVERLAY=50" parameter.
    - And finally, on my own configuration, the  overlay  option  causes  issues
    with the ToolBar option. The display zone exceeds the window borders. So,  I
    implemented a patch which resolves this bug (see  the  PatchOverlay  command
    line available within this archive).

@{b}* Potential bug with the server "color map" concept@{ub}
    This problem can take place using an indexed color map (<=256 colors) on the
    server side. The VNC RFB protocol allows the server  to  send  a  predefined
    color map to the client. Up to now, few servers support this  functionality,
    because they have the possibility to exchange  graphic information  in  true
    color mode (the color is coded by the pixel) with the client, even for 8-bit
    displays.
    TwinVNC is thus supposed to handle this fonctionality but has not  yet  been
    tested.

@node "Doc_Note" "Notes about tested VNC Servers"
@{b}@{u}Notes about tested VNC Servers@{uu}@{ub}

@{b}@{i}* With server Tight 1.2.9:@{ui}@{ub}
    No problem. I've been using this one for some time  with  a  very  efficient
    ZLibRaw codec.


@{b}@{i}* With server Tight 1.3beta4:@{ui}@{ub}
    The server randomly crashes when using other codecs that  Tight  (also  when
    using TightVNC as client). The server sends corrupt data  when  using  CoREE
    encoding, which also causes TwinVNC  crashes.  This  problem  was  fixed  by
    adding preventive clipping before encoding.


@{b}@{i}* With server Tight 1.3beta5:@{ui}@{ub}
    No server crashes with ZLibRaw encoding. Data is still corrupt  with  CoREE,
    but TwinVNC uses a walkaround.
    Looks like the server sometimes "forgets" to refresh certain  screen  areas,
    also happens with TightVNC client.


@{b}@{i}* With the Tight 1.3.x server: @{ui}@{ub}
    Since TwinVNC 0.92, it is no longer possible to type an  accented  character
    correctly. This is due to  an  incompatibility  between  Tight  VNC 2.x  and
    Tight VNC 1.3.x.


@{b}@{i}* With server RealVNC 4:@{ui}@{ub}
    No problems found with current version of TwinVNC


@{b}@{i}* With all servers:@{ui}@{ub}
    They all have some problems with some refreshed parts! This problem  can  be
    reproduced with TwinVNC as much as with any Windows VNC  Viewer.  Tip:  Just
    click within the modified area so that the server can  notify  it  has  been
    changed and send appropriate data to the client.

@{i}  You doubleclick the  icon  and  a  nice  little  GUI  appears  especially  for
  you... dufus.@{ui}


@{b}* "Ok, I have clicked on the icon and something started. What happens now?"@{ub}

@{i}  You need to connect to a VNC server to be able to take control of something (I
  would suggest that you start with your life).
  There are lots of @{"VNC servers" link "Doc_Servers" 0}, covering all OS's.
  You need to  enter  the  IP address of the server (as  well  as  the  port  if
  this is not the default 5900) in the zone "Host" and the password to  the  VNC
  service running on the host.@{ui}


@{b}* "Ok, I've done everything correctly but nothing happens afterwards."@{ub}

@{i}  Check that their is no  firewall.  If  you  have  access  to  the  server  try
  disabling the firewall.@{ui}


@{b}* "Ok, it connects but I get an error message saying that  the  authentification
  doesn't work."@{ub}

@{i}  Your password is wrong!!! Check CAPS LOCK.@{ui}


@{b}* "Arghhhh, I have lost my connection box when I launch from the icon."@{ub}

@{i}  Delete the tooltypes Host and Pass in the icon.@{ui}


@{b}* "I connect to several VNC servers and I'm fed up typing in the bloody hosts!"@{ub}

@{i}  The host selection list keeps a history.  Just  play  with  the  up  and  down
  arrows to find the host your want.@{ui}


@{b}* "Automatic screen mode detection does not give excellent results. Why?"@{ub}

@{i}  TwinVNC uses system functions to obtain the best screen mode.
  If the screen mode decided by the system is not optimal, it  is  advisable  to
  force the one you want, either with the MODEID option as an argument,  or  via
  the "Display" tab in the options box.@{ui}

@{b}* Crisot (26/02/2007): French user of AmigaOS4@{ub}
  @{i}[Translation from french]@{ui}

  "TwinVNC is the best client I've ever used.

  Tip: use always the most adapted codec depending on  your  computer/connection
  performances.
  Even though the Tight codec is  always  the  best  for  a  remote  connection,
  ZLibRaw can often be more efficient for a local office software use.
  Even when playing games, with a powerful server,  I've  already  noticed  that
  ZLibHex can be faster, optimising games or videos on low resolutions.
  Test this, it depends of your server cpu and ethernet/wifi performances.

  Other tip: there is an embedded no display mode in TwinVNC. What for? A  click
  over on a well designed icon, you can tranform your Amiga  into  an  extremely
  useful virtual KVM.

  I go on and on about this app! Its overlay, its quick and  efficient  software
  scaling, its clear performances (test an other client on  an  other  computer,
  then you will see that the codec  choice  is  not  always  easy).  TwinVNC  is
  ultimate!"


@{b}* Batteman (21/02/2007): French user of MorphOS@{ub}
  @{i}[Translation from french]@{ui}

  "I came across TwinVNC accidentally. Indeed, at the moment this  new  software
  came out on the Amiga scene, I had no idea of what it could actually do.
  After picking up some information on the VNC protocol, I  realised  that  this
  type of software was not made for me as I only have an iBook.  But  I  however
  did install a VNC server on it to play around with TwinVNC to  do  some  grabs
  for Seg.

  The purpose of this app then seemed obvious to me but not  with  a  laptop  as
  server. So, I'll have to wait another couple of years before I get  back  down
  to  TwinVNC.  After  having  won  a  PC  during  Alchemy 6,  having  installed
  Ubuntu 6.10 and tweaked the Ubuntu VNC server to run automatically, I  finally
  could start using TwinVNC again, and I do!

  It allows me to do many things: using only one keyboard and mouse  to  control
  my Pegasos under MorphOS and to control the PC.  It  allows  me  to  use  this
  Ubuntu PC more than I would because I can  now  transparently  use  apps  that
  don't exist on MorphOS, as a 'modern' web browser  or  a  torrent  client  for
  example.

  Therefore, I can use them without even realising  that  I'm  using  a  PC  and
  that's great.

  I personally use TwinVNC on its own screen with the title bar in order to have
  the feeling that I'm still using MorphOS. TwinVNC has changed my  user  habits
  and allowed me to save money (buying an extra screen) and space (you  do  have
  to put that additional screen somewhere), and  most  of  all,  it  renews  the
  pleasure of using MorphOS.

  What can I say more? Use it, you'll see  for  yourself!  And  do  think  about
  clicking the Paypal link... Seg should appreciate that!"
